# ZTA

The existing approaches to system and networking seurity, based on perimeter security and/or defence in depth mechanisms is about to changen in favor of a so called Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).

One of the leading publications is the NIST SP 800-207 document for which a summary is given below:

## Summary of NIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

NIST SP 800-207 outlines a framework for implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to enhance cybersecurity. Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats can come from inside and outside the network and emphasizes strict access controls, continuous verification, and minimal trust levels.

#### Key Principles of ZTA:

* Continuous Verification: Authentication and authorization are performed continuously, not just at the point of entry.
* Least Privilege Access: Access is granted only to resources explicitly needed.
* Assume Breach: Operate under the assumption that an adversary is already in the environment.
* Resource Protection: Resources are segmented and accessed independently based on policies.

#### Components of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

NIST SP 800-207 identifies seven primary components that define a Zero Trust Architecture:

1. Policy Decision Point (PDP)

The brain of the ZTA that makes access decisions based on policies and context.
It consists of:
* Policy Engine: Evaluates policies to grant or deny access.
* Policy Administrator: Implements policies by configuring enforcement points.

2. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)

Enforces access decisions made by the PDP.
It acts as the gatekeeper, allowing or denying access to resources based on PDP instructions.

3. Enterprise Resources

The assets or systems that require protection (e.g., databases, applications, cloud resources, or devices).
Resources are secured and accessed based on strict policies.

4. Subject

Any entity (user, device, or application) attempting to access enterprise resources.
Authentication and authorization processes focus on verifying the subject's identity and context.

5. Resource Access Policies

Define the rules for accessing resources.
Policies can be based on:
* User identity: Role, group membership.
* Device state: Compliance, patch status.
* Contextual factors: Time, location, behavioral patterns.

6. Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)

Provides real-time monitoring and visibility into the network's security posture.
Ensures that policies remain effective and that any anomalies or threats are quickly identified and mitigated.

7. Threat Intelligence

Provides data on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
Helps the system adapt policies and responses dynamically to evolving risks.

#### Supporting Elements in ZTA

To achieve full implementation, ZTA incorporates additional components and strategies, including:

* Identity and Access Management (IAM): Ensures robust authentication and authorization for subjects.
* Network Segmentation: Divides the network into smaller zones to limit lateral movement.
* Data Security: Protects data at rest, in motion, and in use with encryption and other controls.
* Logging and Analytics: Collects and analyzes logs for auditing, compliance, and threat detection.
* Secure Access Service Edge (SASE): Combines networking and security functions into a unified cloud-delivered service to support ZTA in distributed environments.

#### Benefits of ZTA

* Reduced Attack Surface: Minimizes exposure to threats by limiting access.
* Improved Incident Response: Facilitates faster detection and mitigation of breaches.
* Enhanced Compliance: Meets regulatory and data privacy requirements more effectively.
* Adaptability: Responds dynamically to changing security landscapes.

This comprehensive framework enables organizations to transition from traditional perimeter-based security to a more robust, adaptable, and secure zero-trust model.

### ZTA-Prototyping

As you see, none of the mentioned existing packages are open, vendor-independend or do implement the entire stack, proposed by NIST. So with this said, this is an approach to prototype the entire NIST stack as a POC, for testing and educational purpouses.

#### Current status
This is a early-code prototyping sketch for  the NIST SP 800-207 specs for a ZTA based security architecture. 

#### Basics first
This POC is mainly be writen in Python to make prototyping easy. It is by no means ment to be performant or scalable. However some design-consideration tend into this direction. One is, besides a vertical scalability, the base-desing should also allow a horizontal scalability. Another point that adresses the potential perfomrance and definite addresses resilience of the system is the chosen database for most of the datamanagement. Details about that considaration can be found in the wiki.

#### Project/POC parts
The projects main part are the components in the controlplane. Second, sole for the purpouse of this POC and some tests, are the external mocking parts, that will simulate typical external components of a ZTA, as descibed in the NIST and other documents.
